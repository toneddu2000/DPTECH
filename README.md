Scratch game framework for Darkplaces Engine http://icculus.org/twilight/darkplaces
This wants to be a humble attempt to create a common framework for developers that want to use modern features offered by Darkplaces Engine like skeletal animations, realtime lighting, realistic physics interaction and so on. This game code is completely freed by IdSoftware Quake code, so it's released under CC0 1.0 Universal (you can do basically whatever you want with this code).The only files not covered by CC0 1.0 Universal are defs files generated by Darkplaces itself which, of course, are tied to GPL license as the engine is.
